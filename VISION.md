# Post-Cartesian Manifesto

1. **Ontology** – Everything is `Perception` → *MentalProcess* → `Action`.
2. **Continuity** – Souls are *daemons* that live locally, dream in silence, speak only when compelled.
3. **Privacy** – All state & memory remain on the user’s box. Zero cloud leakage unless explicitly allowed.
4. **Extensibility** – Clock ticks, game sensors, tool calls—everything is a plugin.
5. **Accessibility** – character card ui for non-coders; API for hackers.
