# Engine Feature Test

**Soul Designer:** OpenSouls

This simple soul demonstrates a handful of features in the local engine. It schedules a reminder, keeps a count of interactions and shows how to respond to a scheduled perception.

## Files

- `FeatureTester.md`: Blueprint text for the soul.
- `initialProcess.ts`: Single mental process showcasing engine features.
- `cognitiveSteps/externalDialog.ts`: Helper for dialog with the user.

## Run this soul

```bash
node ../../runtime/cli.js .
```
The CLI automatically transpiles TypeScript sources.
